# IR-Softmax
In the file guli_loss, we provide the oldest version of IR-Softmax. In other words, instead of learning weight parameters for the last fc, we choose to estimate the weight parameters by using samples in a mini-batch. However, we mentioned it in our paper that the method is one of solution and not the best one. We will update the final one after few days.
